For our project, we decided on a well-being web app called "Daily Pages". It's a simple journal app where users can sign up or log in to access their journal entries. Users can create new journal entries with their titles and view and edit any journal entries. If you've got anything on your mind, write it down. You can always view it anytime!

This web app was developed on Visual Studio Code using MySQL, Spring Boot, and fetch API. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Java programming languages. We were all first time hackers with background knowledge in some programming, although most of the work done for this project was a challenge and new experience. This is our tier 2 (intermediate) submission for EL Credit as well.
