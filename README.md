For our project, we decided on a well-being web app called "Daily Pages". It's a simple journal app where users can sign up or log in to access their journal entries. Users can create new journal entries with their titles and view and edit any journal entries. If you've got anything on your mind, write it down. You can always view it anytime!

This web app was developed on Visual Studio Code using MySQL, Spring Boot, and fetch API. We used HTML, CSS, Javascript, and the Java programming languages. We were all first time hackers with background knowledge in some programming, although most of the work done for this project was a challenge and new experience. This is our tier 2 (intermediate) submission for EL Credit as well. 

Disha (backend developer) - Worked on the SQL databses for the user (username and password) and journal entries (title, date, and content). Helped Anika with server side work using Spring Boot to fetch data from Javascript to send to Java to store in our SQL databases. 

Anika (backend developer) - Main backend developer. Worked on the SQL databases alongside Disha and programmed the exchange of information from Javascript to Java to the SQL databases (and from backend to frontend as well).

Erich (frontend developer) - Worked on the UI of the web app, designing the welcome, sign up, login, entry, and entries list page. Worked on HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
